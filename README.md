# EscapeThePyramid-HTMLCSSJS-IIPIATA

```November 13th 2020```

For this project for my studies I had to make my first interactive website that would support a boardgame, 
which I had to make for the RMO, Rijksmuseum van Oudheden. The subject of the boardgame was Escape the Pyramid, 
which was an inspired by the boardgame "Doolhof".
The game was aimed at children, had questions about ancient Egypt, and their pyramids, and could be played by two players.

This website was an addition to learn more about pyramids and could be used to see what kind of ending the players got after 
playing the game.

One of the challenges I had during this project was making the whole site responsive, because I had no proprietary experience 
with this concept.
